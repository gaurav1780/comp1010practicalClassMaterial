## Workshop - Lists 2

This week, we'll practise some more with `ArrayList` of objects and iterators. The classes required (`Rectangle`, `Box`) are provided in [codes](./codes) directory.

### Question 1

Create an `ArrayList` of `Rectangle` objects named `rectangles`.

### Question 2

Add 100 rectangle objects, each with a random width between 1 and 10 (inclusive on both sides) and a random height between 1 and 10 (inclusive on both sides) to the list `rectangles`.

### Question 3

Create an `ArrayList` of `Box` objects named `boxes`.

### Question 4

Add 100 `Box` objects, each with a random width between 1 and 10 (inclusive on both sides) and a random height between 1 and 10 (inclusive on both sides) and a random depth between 1 and 10 (inclusive on both sides) to the list `boxes`.

### Question 5

Count the number of objects in the list `boxes` that have a width of 5 or more.

### Question 6

Find the sum of the volumes of the objects in the list `boxes` where the base has an area of 20 or more.

### Question 7 

Create an iterator and display each object in list `boxes` from the first item to the last item.

### Question 8

Create an iterator and display each object in list `boxes` from the last item to the first item.

### Question 9

Using an iterator, remove all objects from the list `boxes` that have square bases.

### Question 10

Using an iterator, add a unit `Box` object (of dimensions 1 by 1 by 1) **after** every item that has an even depth.

### Question 11

Using an iterator, add a unit `Box` object (of dimensions 1 by 1 by 1) **before** every item that has an even depth.
